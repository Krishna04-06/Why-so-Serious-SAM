## Overview

The **Why-so-Serious-SAM** project aims to highlight vulnerabilities in Windows systems, specifically focusing on the exploitation of shadow copies. This technique allows for persistence and stealth, making it a relevant study for both red and blue teams. 

### Key Features

- Exploits CVE-2021-36934.
- Fileless malware approach.
- Educational tools for threat detection.
- Insights into hybrid malware tactics.

## Motivation

Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field. With new vulnerabilities emerging, understanding how to exploit and defend against them is crucial. This project provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to explore the implications of CVE-2021-36934 and improve their defensive strategies.

## Technical Details

### What is CVE-2021-36934?

CVE-2021-36934 is a vulnerability that arises from improper ACLs on Windows shadow copies. This flaw allows unauthorized access to sensitive data, making it a prime target for attackers. By leveraging this vulnerability, attackers can execute malicious code without being detected.

### Fileless Malware

Fileless malware operates in memory, avoiding traditional detection methods that rely on file signatures. This approach makes it difficult for conventional antivirus solutions to identify and mitigate threats. Understanding fileless malware is vital for modern cybersecurity practices.

### Hybrid Malware

Hybrid malware combines techniques from both file-based and fileless approaches. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in executing attacks. The **Why-so-Serious-SAM** project illustrates how these tactics can be integrated for more effective exploitation.
